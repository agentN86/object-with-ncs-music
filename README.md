# Object with NCS Music
This project consists with two things- an object and some music.

This is a fun short project where you can make your own "Object with NCS Music" video. They consist of some of the same songs (which you can find in the [music list](https://agentn86.neocities.org/objectwithncs/musiclist.txt)) as the original channel has, but the user gets to choose what kind of object they want. It can be a pickaxe, flashlight, or maybe even the Github icon.

# Limitations
Currently, you can only use **.png** as your file source. If your image file is not a PNG, you should put it through a converter that allows turning your image to a PNG.
